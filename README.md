# Credit-Card-Debt-Calculator

Write them a program that would calculate how long it would take to pay off the card. The program should 
let the user input the amount owed and the amount they are going to pay each month, and then calculate how many 
months of payments will be required.

Annual interest rate = 19.9% 

There are a few rules that must be checked: 
a. Card balance and monthly payment amount cannot be negative 

b. The monthly payment is 2.00% of the outstanding balance. (If we donâ€™t have a minimum payment, then we could end up 
in a situation where the interest charge for the month is greater than the payment.) 

c. Use the following rule for the interest and the payment: Each month you should add the interest first, and then 
deduct the payment made on the card.  

The output should be the beginning balance, the amount you indicate you are going to pay, the 
number of months it will take to pay off the card, and the amount of the very last payment. 
^ Output the results for how long it will take them to pay off the card in the number of years and months, instead of just as the number of months.
